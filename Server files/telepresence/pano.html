So just one      image is necessary to display a complete 360x180 panorama.      <h2>Purpose</h2>      I mainly was curious how fast equirectangular panorama image can be      displayed with a HTML5 canvas. So the script isn't cleaned up very well,      but it gave me at least an idea that it is possible. On my an Intel Core      i7 CPU I get more than 20 frames per second. That is of course not very      fast but usable. And the best of all it doesn't require any Plug-Ins :)      <h2>Navigation</h2>      <ul>        <li>Left/Right Mouse drag: Changes camera heading. </li>        <li>Up/Sown Mouse drag: Changes camera pitch. </li>        <li>Scroll wheel: Changes camera field of view. </li>        <li>I-Key: Displays Info panel with canvas size, image size and FPS. </li>      </ul>      <h2>Requirements</h2>      I've tested this HTML5 panorama script with the latest versions of Safari,      Firefox and Chrome on Mac OS X. But it should also run on other platforms      supporting HTML5. <br>      <br>      <h2>License</h2>      The html5pano.js script is released under the Simplified BSD License.      Please see comments within the script.<br>      <br>      <h2>Dowload</h2>      Please use the following link to download the script including a sample      panorama image. <br>      <br>      <br>      <br>      <br>      <br>      <a href="http://cheetah3d.com">17.Aug.2010, Martin Wengenmayer</a> </div>  </body></html>
